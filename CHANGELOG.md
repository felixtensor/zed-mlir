# Changelog

This document records shipped project history reconstructed from the local Git
tags. Dates are tag or commit dates. The v0.1.0 tag was restored
retroactively on the last commit that still declared version 0.1.0.

For future plans, see [docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md).

### Changed

- Render TableGen `[{ ... }]` code literals as string-like source regions
  instead of generic embedded content.

### Added

- Wired up all three upstream LLVM language servers:
  `mlir-lsp-server`, `mlir-pdll-lsp-server`, and `tblgen-lsp-server`.

  highlights, indentation, bracket matching, and symbol outline.
- Added README feedback and contribution guidance.

### Improved

- Ordered PDLL highlights for Zed's last-match-wins query semantics.
- Improved PDLL builtin type constraint highlighting.
- Improved TableGen highlighting for member access and `let` item fields.
