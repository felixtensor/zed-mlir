;; Inject tree-sitter-cpp into TableGen code blocks — but ONLY when the
;; enclosing field is unambiguously C++ code, not arbitrary text.
;; Editors should provide tree-sitter-cpp as a sibling parser.
;;
;; Per the LLVM TableGen ProgRef, `code` is an alias for `string`; on the
;; parser side they produce indistinguishable values. The two cases below
;; therefore key on different signals and cannot be collapsed:
;;   Case 1 — declared type is literally `code`, so any [{ ... }] is C++.
;;   Case 2 — declared type is `string` (or anything else), so we instead
;;            gate on a known C++-carrying ODS field name.
;; Counter-example deliberately NOT injected: `string assemblyFormat = "..."`
;; is the op assembly DSL, not C++.

;; Case 1: field declared with `code` type — always C++.
;;   code extraClassDeclaration = [{ ... }];
